// Managed Agents — shared Anthropic client + env resolver.
//
// First Managed Agents surface in core/. Lives in approval-ui (vs a
// separate agent-managed service) for v1 — the code path is small
// enough that an extra service + cross-service plumbing isn't worth
// the architectural cleanliness yet. If MA grows beyond /digest into
// research-crew or vertical-pack composition, extracting a dedicated
// service is the right move; for now keep it inline.
//
// Why Managed Agents at all (vs CrewAI / LangGraph already in core/):
//   - CrewAI is for per-draft choreography (8-role sequential crew).
//   - LangGraph is for state-machine control loops (publish_pipeline).
//   - Managed Agents is for stateful multi-step specialist sub-tasks
//     where Anthropic provides the container + agent loop. The /digest
//     narrative generation is the v1 use case: read workspace data,
//     write a 200-word recap, optionally render a video. Future
//     candidates: research crew, vertical-pack composition.
//
// Architecture decisions documented inline so a future dev knows why
// the integration looks the way it does.
