// seed-demo.ts — synthetic demo workspace for design partners and local dev.
//
// Populates a single tenant (the "Demo Workspace") with realistic content so
// every Mission Control tile + page renders against actual data instead of
// the empty-state. Idempotent: re-running rebuilds the same final state by
// wiping the demo tenant up front and re-inserting with deterministic UUIDs.
//
// Run from the approval-ui package directory:
//   pnpm exec tsx scripts/seed-demo.ts
//
// Required env: DATABASE_URL (the Postgres connection string the Drizzle
// client reads in lib/db/client.ts).
//
// What this script does NOT seed:
//   - content_embeddings: vector(384) needs a real embedder to produce
//     non-degenerate vectors; recall_lessons would surface noise from random
//     floats. Wire this in after the embedder service has a /embed endpoint.
//   - bandit-orchestrator state at BANDIT_DATA_DIR/{id}.json: filesystem-
//     scoped to that container; out of scope for the approval-ui seeder.
